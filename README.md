## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Structure**

The project follows a modular and scalable architecture:



üöß **Out of Scope Features**
While the current implementation focuses on core functionality, the following features are planned for future iterations:

- **Password Lock Screen**: Enhance security by adding a password-protected lock screen.
- **Additional EVM Networks**: Support for Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, and more.
- **Optimized Wallet List**: Implement lazy loading and optimize API calls for wallet balances.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Refine the design and user experience for better usability.

**And more...**

üß™ **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests**: Written using React Testing Library to ensure component reliability.
- **Integration Tests**: Validate interactions between components and Redux store.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Planned for future iterations using tools like Playwright or Cypress.
